# âš¡ Forecasting Electricity Demand PJM and MISO Markets
This is a final capstone group based project that I made for the course MGT300 at the University of Toronto. The dataset used for this project comes from Kaggle and it contains 5 years of time series data split into 15-minute intervals on MISO and PJM electricity markets.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
This project aims to forecast electricity demand in the PJM and MISO electricity markets to support more efficient utility management and long-term infrastructure planning.

Specifically, we :
